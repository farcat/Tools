# Tools
Smaller general purpose tools for e.g. caching or attribute access

caching.py contains a simple (but somewhat powerful) caching decorator for function return values based on its arguments. See the class __doc__ for more info.

accessors.py contains simple type checking and validation for attribute access (read and write). See class __doc__'s for more info.
